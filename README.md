A suggestion of how the artsy folder structure could be

This project does not "run" it's just copy paste of code to showcase structure

### How to think about atoms, molecules and organisms?

If it uses an atom, it's a molecule.

If it uses a molecule, it's an atom.

And so on.

These definitions are just there as a guideline and not supposed to be super strict.

### Design as a Guideline

We also want to follow the same idea as we have on the [Design], in Figma

[Atoms]: Buttons, radios, checkboxes, dropdown menus, input, icons, banners, tiles, pills
[Molecules]: headers, carousels, "content", "editorial"\*

Atoms and Molecules are the suggested ones, but if we want to take it a step further we can also consider Organisms, Templates and Pages

[Organisms]: grids
[Templates]: auctions, fairs, galleries
[Pages]: Home, Fairs, Auctions, Sell With Artsy

\* Whatever is in quotes (" ") means we can argue about that...
